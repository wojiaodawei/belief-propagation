# Pearl's Belief Propagation Algorithm

~~ *This project was implemented in February 2018* ~~

Stochastic optimization: probabilistic modeling and inference by the Pearl's Belief Propagation Algorithm.

## Purpose of Algorithm
* Pearl, 1988
```
"... deals with fusing and propagating the impact of new evidence and beliefs through Bayesian networks so that each proposition eventually will be assigned a certainty measure consistent with the axioms of probalility theory." 
```

## Running

We can test the algorithm on two different Python-encoded networks (*main_ex_cours.py*, *main.py*).
To run the algorithm, just execute the script *run.sh* by giving as argument a network:
```
./run.sh src/main.py
```
or 
```
./run.sh src/main_ex_cours.py
```
